Welcome! This is my little corner of the internet where I dump code I’ve written—whether it’s a brilliant idea, a terrible experiment, or something that hardly works but def “works on my machine.”

You might find tools, scripts, or projects that solve very specific problems (usually mine), or code I wrote at 2am and never looked at again. Either way, enjoy the chaos.

Disclaimer (aka: please don’t sue me)
A few things to keep in mind before you copy-paste anything from here into production (bless your brave soul):

This stuff is mostly for me, not the world. Use at your own risk.

If something explodes, breaks your system, or summons a demon through the gates of hell, that’s on you, not me.

I don't guarantee updates, support, or even that I remember writing the thing you're looking at.

Basically: if it helps you, awesome. If it breaks everything… well, you were warned. 😄
