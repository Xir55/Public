Privacy Policy (a.k.a. “I’m not spying on you, I promise”)
Hey there! Just a quick note about privacy, because apparently that’s something we should talk about when using tools powered by large language models.

If you’re using one of my GPT-based tools, here’s what you need to know:

What I (don’t) do:
I don’t collect, save, sell, or train anything based on what you type. I’m not building a secret archive of your prompts or storing your data for fun.

I’m not interested in tracking you, profiling you, or monetizing your thoughts. Honestly, I’ve got enough of my own problems.

What might happen anyway:
Depending on how this tool is running (like through OpenAI, an API, or another platform), those services might log or process your inputs. That’s on them, and you should check their privacy policies if you’re concerned.

If this tool is part of a website or app, it might collect some basic technical stuff (like browser type or usage stats), but I’m not doing anything sneaky with it.

In short:
Don’t enter anything sensitive unless you’re okay with the possibility that someone, somewhere, might be looking. I’m not, but the platforms that power this might be.

If I ever build something that actually handles or stores your data, I’ll be clear and up-front about it. Pinky promise.
