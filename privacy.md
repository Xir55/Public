Privacy Policy (aka: Why I’m Not Spying on You)
Hey! Just a quick note on privacy, because I know it matters—and also because I don’t want anyone thinking I’m secretly collecting your data to do something nefarious with it. I'm not. Honestly, I’ve got enough of my own problems to solve, and absolutely zero interest (or time) to worry about yours.

Here’s the deal:
I don’t collect, store, log, analyze, or quietly archive anything you type here. No tracking, no analytics, no "helpful" cookies. What you say stays between you and the machine—for as long as the machine remembers it, which isn’t long.

When you use this GPT, there’s no memory, no snooping, and no secret vault of conversations. I built this for myself—to experiment, fix annoyances in my own workflow, or test ideas that may or may not make sense in the light of day. That’s it.

So what’s the catch?
There isn’t one. I’m not trying to optimize engagement, gather intel, or run ads. I'm just busy tinkering with stuff that solves my problems, not tracking yours.

That said, this is a tool, not a polished product. If you're thinking of dumping in your passwords, company secrets, or anything you'd regret shouting in a crowded room—maybe don’t? Use at your own risk.

Bottom line: I respect your privacy, mostly because I don’t want your data and definitely don’t have time to do anything with it even if I did.
